More than two months into the new year, but better late than never, here is _Things I Learned in 2023_. This marks the fourth installment of my annual review, officially making it a series. As always, what follows are some surprising, entertaining, or enlightening things I stumbled upon in 2023.

1. [South Korea has a unique way of counting a person's age 🇰🇷👴.](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/08/1141524578/south-korea-age-counting-koreans-younger)
	South Korea has enacted a new law that modifies the method for calculating ages, transitioning from the traditional "Korean age" system to the international standard. Currently, South Korea employs three age-counting systems, yet the majority of citizens follow the "Korean age," wherein a person is considered 1 year old at birth and gains an additional year on every New Year's Day. Consequently, a baby born on Dec. 31 would be regarded as 2 years old the following day.

2. [Coffee contains a surprisingly high amount of fiber ☕.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/coffee-vs-tea-nutrition-health/)
	A cup of coffee contains between 1.1 and 1.8 grams of fiber, which is 2x-3x the amount found in orange juice. 
	By the way, tea is approximately 3x more popular than coffee, with only water surpassing its popularity.

3. [Bumblebees exhibit play-like behavior 🐝🥎.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347222002366)
	Bumblebees have been observed engaging in playful activities, specifically rolling balls, which meets established criteria for animal play behavior. This activity seems to be intrinsically rewarding for the bees, unrelated to immediate survival needs. Notably, younger bees and males tend to engage in these play behaviors more frequently and for longer durations, respectively.
	
4. [There are only two original words for tea 🍵.](https://qz.com/1176962/map-how-the-word-tea-spread-over-land-and-sea-to-conquer-the-world)
	The term for tea in almost every language derives from just two sources: "cha" and "tea," both of which originated in China and spread via the Silk Road and Dutch trade, respectively. "Cha" disseminated overland, while "tea" spread by sea, mirroring historical trade patterns.

5. [By the time the Saturn V rocket clears the launch tower, it has expended 4% of its fuel 🚀.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=7n3--k_cGyE)
	The Saturn V, the largest rocket ever launched, consumed fuel at a rate of 15 tons per second. This rate of consumption means that by the time it clears the launch tower, 4% of its fuel has already been used.

6. [Arctic reindeer can perceive UV light ❄️🦌🔦.](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-13529152)
	Research has shown that Arctic reindeer can see ultraviolet light, an adaptation that may aid them in detecting predators such as wolves and locating food sources like lichen in the challenging and UV-rich Arctic environments. Unlike humans, reindeer seem unaffected by potential eye damage from UV exposure.

7. [In 1810, nails were as important to the US economy as industries like personal computers or air travel are today 🔨💻✈️.](https://aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.36.1.125)
	Between the late 1700s and the mid-20th century, the real price of nails dropped by a factor of about 10. The evolution from hand-forged to machine-cut, and eventually to wire nails, reflects the broader industrial transition from artisanal to factory and continuous-process production.

8. [All the gold ever mined could fill approximately three Olympic-sized swimming pools 🏆🏊‍♀️.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/were-long-long-way-running-070016810.html?guccounter=1)
	The total amount of gold ever mined (~197,576 tons) could fit into a cube with 22-meter-long edges. About half of this gold has been mined since 1976.

9. [Agriculture's softer foods reshaped our jaws and introduced us to 'F' and 'V' sounds 🗣🦷.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav3218)
	The shift to farming and softer foods during the Neolithic era resulted in humans developing lasting overbites, which significantly reduced the effort required to produce labiodental sounds such as "f" and "v." This development has been linked to the proliferation of these sounds in modern languages.

10. [Clay soil influenced the early development of romantic literature in Europe 💘✍️.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01292-z)
	 Regions with clay-rich soils adopted the heavy plow sooner, leading to a significant shift from kin-based to manorial societies. This transformation not only foregrounded romantic love but also significantly contributed to improving literacy rates, thus fostering the cultural evolution of love in literary history.

11. [Medieval duels permitted women to fight men under equitable conditions ⚔️🤺.](http://www.aemma.org/onlineResources/trial_by_combat/combat_man_and_woman.htm)
    In medieval Germany, before 1200, the law allowed husbands and wives to resolve their disputes through combat. To ensure fairness, the husband was required to stand in a waist-deep hole, while both parties were armed with clubs.

12. [What causes bean-induced flatulence? 🫘🌬](https://www.seriouseats.com/bean-science-how-to-reduce-gas-tested-6755268)
    Foods that induce flatulence contain ingredients called FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols), which humans cannot digest. While our gut bacteria can digest them, the byproduct of this bacterial digestion is gas. The FODMAPs found in beans are primarily a small group of oligosaccharides (complex sugars).

13. [The word _Tsar_ is derived from the Latin word _caesar_ 🥇🇷🇺.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar)
    The term was intended to signify _emperor_ — a ruler of the same rank as a Roman emperor, holding the title by approval of another emperor or a supreme ecclesiastical official, such as the Pope or the Ecumenical Patriarch. However, it was often considered by Western Europeans to be equivalent to _king_.

14. [Humans began wearing clothes 100,000 years earlier than previously believed 👚👖.](https://www.openculture.com/2023/01/humans-first-started-wearing-clothes-at-least-300000-years-ago-new-research-finds.html)
    Recent discoveries have pushed the earliest known use of clothing back to 300,000 years ago. This conclusion is based on the examination of cut marks on cave bear remains from Schöningen, Germany, suggesting that early humans adeptly skinned bears for their pelts.

15. [Early Britons had dark skin 10,000 years ago ☀️🇬🇧.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheddar_Man)
    Cheddar Man, the oldest near-complete human skeleton found in Britain, has shed significant light on the traits of Western European hunter-gatherers. DNA analysis indicates that, around 10,000 years ago, dark skin was prevalent in the area, in contrast to the lighter skin of modern Europeans, which resulted from later immigration and genetic contributions from farmers and pastoralists.

16. [The shape of a cat’s pupils correlates with their hunting styles and habitats 🐈👁️.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLtreZkkL0)
    Cats with vertical slit pupils are typically ambush predators, benefiting from enhanced depth perception and light control, which aids in hunting close to the ground. Vertical pupils allow cats to precisely control light entry, expanding their pupils up to 300-fold, providing superior vision along the y-axis and excellent depth perception. Round pupils, in contrast, can expand only about 15-fold. Consequently, larger cats, like lions and tigers, who pursue their prey, often have round pupils.  

17. [JPEG images contain hidden pixels if their dimensions are not divisible by 8 🖼️🎱.](https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/979-Six-Million-Pictures.html)
    JPEG images are encoded on an 8x8 grid. If the image dimensions are not multiples of 8, padding is required. This padding differs by JPEG library; for instance, Adobe uses a mirrored pattern, while *libjpeg* repeats the last pixel's value.

18. [One factory manufactures the majority of microwave ovens sold in the US 🔬🌊🇺🇸.](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-microwave/)
    Midea, a giant appliance manufacturer, produces most countertop microwaves sold in the U.S. under various brands, including Toshiba, GE, Whirlpool, and Sharp. Galanz, another major player in microwave manufacturing, produces about half of the world’s microwaves and is located approximately a 30-minute drive from Midea.
    
    Bonus: 
    LG and Samsung manufacture their microwaves independently. Panasonic produces its own mid-range and high-end countertop models, though its budget models appear to be manufactured by Midea.

19. [The global popularity of Thai cuisine results from deliberate _gastrodiplomacy_ 🇹🇭🍲.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_cuisine#Culinary_diplomacy)
    Launched in 2002, the _Global Thai_ program was a government-led culinary diplomacy initiative aimed at increasing the number of Thai restaurants worldwide. This effort is seen as crucial in promoting tourism and boosting exports from Thailand's agricultural sector.

Despite its pivotal role in eradicating smallpox, the origins of the vaccinia virus remain a mystery, with no natural reservoir identified. Genetic analysis suggests a close relationship to horsepox, yet the pathway through which vaccinia became central to the vaccine remains unresolved.
    
30. [Bees are so small and their wings move so rapidly that the air around their wings acts like thick syrup 🐝💨🍯.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/05/11/how-do-bees-fly/)
    Due to their diminutive size and the fast movement of their wings, bees function within a low Reynolds number regime, significantly influenced by air viscosity. This dynamic causes the air around their wings to behave as if it were a denser fluid, similar to syrup or honey. This unique condition offers more resistance but also enables bees to generate the necessary lift for flight by rapidly flapping their wings.  

31. [Magnets are named after a region in Greece 🧲🇬🇷.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0amdIcZt5I)
    The term _magnet_ originates from "stones from _Magnesia_", a region in Greece, where naturally magnetized pieces of the mineral magnetite were discovered over 3000 years ago. These magnetite fragments, known as *lodestones*, had the ability to attract iron or each other.

51. [Road stress caused by vehicles increases in proportion to the fourth power of the axle load.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_power_law)
    - A truck (weight: 30 tonnes, 3 axles ➝ 10 tonnes per axle)
    - A car (weight: 2 tonnes, 2 axles ➝ 1 tonne per axle)
    The _load_ on the road per axle is 10 times greater for the truck than for the car. However, the _damage_ to the road is 10^4=10,000 times as great. 
    Comparatively, a bicycle at 0.05 tonnes per axle causes 1/20th the _load_ and 1/160,000th the damage to the road, meaning the bicycle inflicts the same road damage after 160,000 crossings as a car does in just one.
