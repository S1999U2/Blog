Continuing from [Books I Read in 2022](https://s1999u2.github.io/books-i-read-in-2022/), I want to provide a brief overview of the books I read in 2023. Last year, I spent a significant amount of time commuting and traveling for business, affording me ample opportunity to dive into books. As an agonizingly slow reader, my go-to choice for the past two years has been audiobooks. I anticipate a less hectic 2024, so I'm not setting a goal to read as many books this year.

### [Bill Bryson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7.Bill_Bryson): [A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9791.A_Walk_in_the_Woods)
#### Abstract
Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods" humorously recounts his journey along the Appalachian Trail, blending tales of its stunning scenery, history, and encounters with hikers and wildlife, especially bears. It's a compelling adventure story that evokes a deep appreciation for nature and the joy of exploration.
#### Thoughts
The book provided an engaging and easy read while I meandered through the woods surrounding Tokyo. Although Bill Bryson writes in a relatively light manner and some incidents appear too perfect to be factual, it serves as a pleasant diversion. Moreover, it certainly evokes a desire for hiking.

#### My Rating
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭕


### [Bill Bryson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7.Bill_Bryson): [Notes from a Small Island](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28.Notes_from_a_Small_Island)
#### Abstract
"Notes from a Small Island" by Bill Bryson humorously documents his goodbye journey across Britain, highlighting the country's peculiarities and charms through satirical and affectionate commentary on its culture and oddly named places.
#### Thoughts
A brief journey back in time to the United Kingdom of 30 years ago. Entertaining, yet somewhat drier than the aforementioned book. Perhaps the performance of the German narrator bothered me too much (I did not have access to another version).

⭐⭐⭐⭕⭕


### [Bill Bryson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7.Bill_Bryson): [The Secret History of Christmas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63107517-the-secret-history-of-christmas)
#### Abstract
In his book, Bill Bryson delves into Christmas traditions, uncovering the origins of Boxing Day, "Good King Wenceslas," Christmas crackers, a Welsh folksong turned carol, and the evolution of St. Nicholas into Santa Claus. He reveals surprising histories behind these customs, offering insights into the world's biggest annual celebration.
#### Thoughts
Christmas is a wonderful time of the year, before winter becomes truly uncomfortable, cold, wet, muddy, and dark. The book is quite short (who doesn't find it unbearable when an interesting essay idea has to be inflated into an 800-page book?). It's definitely a fun collection of amusing facts and trivia about Christmas, though it's also a bit random.

### [Jorge Cham](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/300070.Jorge_Cham), [Daniel Whiteson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15662149.Daniel_Whiteson): [We Have No Idea: A Guide to the Unknown Universe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31625636-we-have-no-idea)
#### Abstract
"We Have No Idea" by Jorge Cham and Daniel Whiteson delves into the mysteries of the universe with humor and clear explanations, tackling unsolved cosmological questions and simplifying complex scientific concepts. It's an engaging read for those fascinated by the mysteries of physics.
#### Thoughts
Though I've always had a fondness for [PhD Comics](https://phdcomics.com) (and I've just finished my PhD, I might add), I found this book less exciting to read than the topic would have led me to believe. Perhaps it leaned too much into the "isn't this just unbelievable? We have absolutely no idea" angle and was also quite superficial in terms of its technical depth (I'm an engineer by training, but still found the book to lack depth).
#### My Rating
⭐⭐⭐⭕⭕


### [Tom Clancy](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3892.Tom_Clancy): [Rainbow Six](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5720.Rainbow_Six)
#### Abstract
In "Rainbow Six," Tom Clancy showcases John Clark, an ex-Navy SEAL, leading an international anti-terrorism squad through a series of global crises. As they investigate seemingly unrelated incidents, they uncover a terrifying connection leading to a deadly terrorist group that poses a threat to humanity itself. Clancy's intricate plotting and deep character exploration make "Rainbow Six" a standout in his collection, offering a gripping narrative on the complexities of global terrorism.

#### Thoughts
I listened to the audiobook version while exploring various parts of Yokohama and Tokyo on foot. For this purpose, it was an ideal auditory companion, as it didn't require too much attention (not a technical book) and it's relatively long (Tokyo is *very* big). Although I found the book overall entertaining, it must be said honestly that the story is not very profound, and it's rather soaked with flat stereotypes like vegan eco-terrorists.

As a child, I found the Rainbow Six video games (and all other Tom Clancy games) incredibly cool, so I bought the book in English in my early youth. Understandably, I had neither the vocabulary nor the stamina to read the book at that time - so I was glad to have finally read/heard it after all these years. Maybe I should watch the movie *The Hunt for Red October*...

### [Jonathan Clements](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11044.Jonathan_Clements): [A Brief History of Japan: Samurai, Shogun and Zen: The Extraordinary Story of the Land of the Rising Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34083601-a-brief-history-of-japan)
#### Abstract
Jonathan Clements succinctly narrates Japan's history from its ancient origins to its current global prominence. Highlighting its evolution from a mysterious land of divine emperors to a symbol of the East's allure, Clements explores Japan's journey through isolation, conflict, and rejuvenation. Despite its contradictions, Japan remains a land rich in history, culture, and industrial prowess, offering insights into both its past and its role in shaping the future.
#### Thoughts
I listened to the book in preparation for [my conference](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12327/123270D/Noise-robust-registration-of-microscopic-height-data-using-convolutional-neural/10.1117/12.2644620.short#_=_) in Japan. It's a very interesting story, and the audiobook is also very well narrated. Of course, I've since forgotten all the facts, but it's still a recommendation.

### [Cory Doctorow](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12581.Cory_Doctorow), [Rebecca Giblin](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6176147.Rebecca_Giblin): [Chokepoint Capitalism: How Big Tech and Big Content Captured Creative Labor Markets and How We'll Win Them Back](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60098290-chokepoint-capitalism)
#### Abstract
"Culture Heist" by Rebecca Giblin and Cory Doctorow critiques Big Tech and Big Media's dominance, showing how it harms creators and workers. They offer strategies for resistance, advocating transparency rights, collective action, and fair contracts to counter monopolistic power and promote equity in the digital age.
#### Thoughts
One of my favorite books from last year centers around the concept of [*Enshittification*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification).

>Here is how platforms die: 
>First, they are good to their users;
>then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; 
>finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. 
>Then, they die.

Once you understand this mechanism, what was once a vague observation and feeling over time becomes clear and tangible—if there's a word for it, it suddenly becomes a thing. And we all know Enshittification from countless examples. Nonetheless, the book is worth reading beyond the central idea, as the case studies provide interesting insights. Highly recommended!

### [Israel Finkelstein](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/98755.Israel_Finkelstein), [Neil Asher Silberman](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/98756.Neil_Asher_Silberman): [The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/169479.The_Bible_Unearthed)
#### Abstract
"The Bible Unearthed" by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman reexamines biblical narratives using archaeology, suggesting many stories are symbolic rather than historically accurate. Their analysis challenges traditional interpretations and explores the scriptures' enduring emotional impact.
#### Thoughts
I discovered this book through the [UsefulCharts](https://www.youtube.com/@UsefulCharts) channel. Having been raised in a Christian environment as a child, it was interesting to gain a well-researched and fact-based perspective on the biblical world and its stories. However, I must say that the book is quite detailed, and I found it challenging not to get overwhelmed by the plethora of facts and data.

### [Paul Freiberger](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/671953.Paul_Freiberger), [Michael Swaine](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/671952.Michael_Swaine): [Fire in the Valley: The Making of The Personal Computer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1427580.Fire_in_the_Valley)
#### Abstract
This narrative captures the birth of the personal computer revolution in the 1970s, focusing on visionary figures like Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates, and Gary Kildall in Silicon Valley. It highlights their tireless work and collective vision, which catalyzed a technological revolution with far-reaching impacts on the computing industry.

#### Thoughts
An interesting and fascinating narrative about the early days of the personal computer. A must-read for any true nerd.

### [James Hawes](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/57491.James_Hawes): [The Shortest History of Germany](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34757960-the-shortest-history-of-germany)
#### Abstract
In his concise bestseller, James Hawes provides an accessible overview of Germany's history, from Julius Caesar to Angela Merkel. With over 100 maps and images, the book is designed for easy reading, offering entertainment and insight into centuries of complex history. Hawes challenges perceptions of Germans as either "us" or "them," aiming to demystify German history and culture while offering a fresh perspective on Europe's most admired and feared nation.
#### Thoughts
Although I live in Germany and have grown up and attended school here, we learned relatively little about "the big picture" of German history (or the peoples who lived in this area in the past) in history class. The focus was often on specific periods or other countries, such as the Nazi era, the French Revolution, and again the Nazi era (the processing of the crimes of World War II is still omnipresent nearly 80 years after the war ended). Towards the end of the book, as it approaches the present day and thus also the period I have experienced myself, I'm not sure if I can agree with the author, but I believe this is a general problem with viewing history. The picture, or at least the narrative, often becomes clearer with some temporal distance from the events, for various reasons.

### [Michael A. Hiltzik](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/206718.Michael_A_Hiltzik): [Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1101290.Dealers_of_Lightning)
#### Abstract
"Dealers of Lightning" by Michael Hiltzik uncovers the pioneering innovations at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in the 1970s, laying the groundwork for the digital revolution. Hiltzik celebrates the creativity of the PARC team, who developed early versions of the internet, personal computers, and user-friendly software, despite Xerox's limited recognition. Through interviews with those involved, the book sets the record straight on their significant contributions to tech history.
#### Thoughts
Similar to [Fire in the Valley](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1427580.Fire_in_the_Valley), this book is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding how we, or rather the PC, ended up where we are today.

### [Steven Levy](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32131.Steven_Levy): [The Perfect Thing: How the iPod Shuffles Commerce, Culture, and Coolness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56827.The_Perfect_Thing)
#### Abstract
In this book, a technology columnist from Newsweek explores the origin and rise to popularity of the iPod. The author discusses Apple's unexpected success in the technology industry, the iPod's impact on the music industry, and the pivotal role played by CEO Steve Jobs and his team in revolutionizing the way music is consumed. With a first printing of 100,000 copies, the book provides insights into the cultural and technological significance of the iPod.

#### Thoughts
While not the most factual book, *The Perfect Thing* is an ode to the aesthetic and conceptual uniqueness of the iPod, as well as the revolution it sparked in personal consumer technology. *Everyone* in my school wanted one, and every manufacturer tried to somehow copy it but never succeeded. Detractors have dismissed Apple as overpriced designer tech with no meaningful functions since those days, but its relevance to the world, and particularly to a new Apple that would later culminate in the iPhone, is undeniable.
(And although I would have killed for my own iPod, it wasn't until the iPod Touch in 2008 that I had saved enough money to afford one - what a device!)

### [Tim Marshall](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/713466.Tim_Marshall): [Prisoners of Geography: Ten Maps That Tell You Everything You Need to Know About Global Politics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25135194-prisoners-of-geography)
#### Abstract
"Prisoners of Geography" by Tim Marshall examines how geography shapes global geopolitics. Marshall illustrates how physical features influence nations' strengths and vulnerabilities, offering clear insights into topics like Russia's naval challenges, China's constraints, and Europe's disunity. The book sheds light on geography's significant role in shaping world history and politics.
#### Thoughts
This book presents a novel, clear, and understandable idea to me: geography influences politics. I wish it had been condensed into an essay rather than expanded into a thick book. While the numerous examples are interesting, one grasps the core idea quite quickly.
#### My Rating
⭐⭐⭐⭕⭕


### [Tim Marshall](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/713466.Tim_Marshall): [The Power of Geography: Ten Maps That Reveal the Future of Our World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56696339-the-power-of-geography)
#### Abstract
In his latest book, Tim Marshall examines ten regions shaping global politics, from Australia to Space. With wit and insight, he reveals why Europe faces a refugee crisis, the Middle East must diversify beyond oil, and the eastern Mediterranean is volatile. Marshall also discusses the Earth's atmosphere as a future battleground. Peter Frankopan praises Marshall's ability to distill essential knowledge, making this book another outstanding guide to the modern world.
#### Thoughts
The Tim Marshall books were available as a set, and the first one, despite some lengthy parts, was intriguing enough for me to read this installment as well.

### [Brian Merchant](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15943126.Brian_Merchant): [The One Device: The Secret History of the iPhone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32603496-the-one-device)
#### Abstract
"The One Device" offers an intriguing exploration of the iPhone's creation, delving into the scientific, technological, and business breakthroughs that made it possible. Through engaging storytelling and insights from the original design team, the book provides a multifaceted perspective on the device that revolutionized our world.

#### Thoughts
Well, if you're not an Apple fan and don't follow the company, this book is probably not for you. I, on the other hand, keep up with the company's activities and found the book accordingly worth reading. Whether all the stories are accurate may not be verifiable, but there were some interesting insights into the Cupertino-based company.

### [Emily Oster](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6583172.Emily_Oster): [Expecting Better: Why the Conventional Pregnancy Wisdom is Wrong - and What You Really Need to Know](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158576-expecting-better)
#### Abstract
"Expecting Better" by Emily Oster challenges pregnancy recommendations with evidence-based insights, empowering women to make informed choices. It's a valuable resource for expecting mothers seeking a deeper understanding of their pregnancy journey.

#### Thoughts
The weakest book I read last year. Similar to financial guides (see below) or topics like nutrition, the field surrounding the topic of *children* also suffers from a poor signal-to-noise ratio; it's difficult or nearly impossible to find meaningful literature among all the charlatans, life coaches, and the "I'll show you how it *really* works" crowd. Emily Oster's book was recommended to me from several sources as *the* fact-based book that offers sensible advice based on evidence.
Unfortunately, it didn't work for me at all. To avoid going into a rage, I'll just say that I cannot recommend this book, and anyone looking for something meaningful on this topic will, regrettably, have to look elsewhere.

### [Matt Parker](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17598525.Matt_Parker): [Humble Pi: A Comedy of Maths Errors](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39074550-humble-pi)
#### Abstract
"Humble Pi" is an international bestseller that explores the practicality of math in everyday life. Author Matt Parker uses entertaining anecdotes to reveal the significant consequences of mathematical mistakes, from stock market crashes to plane crashes. With humor and insight, the book highlights the essential role of math while encouraging acceptance of our own mistakes.

#### Thoughts
Anyone familiar with Matt [Parker's](https://www.youtube.com/@standupmaths) videos will love this book. And although I hardly ever watch his videos in my daily routine (for no particular reason), I found the book wonderfully entertaining. Additionally, I watched the related performance, which I had funded on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/standupmaths/matt-parkers-humble-pi-stand-up-show-filming).

### [Stuart Ritchie](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6047776.Stuart_Ritchie): [Science Fictions: How Fraud, Bias, Incompetence, and Hype Undermine the Search for Truth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52079565-science-fictions)
#### Abstract
"Science Fictions" by Dr. Stuart Ritchie delves into biases, hype, incompetence, and fraud in peer-reviewed scientific research, particularly in psychology. Ritchie exposes the replication crisis that has affected various disciplines, revealing widespread unrepeatable experiments and erroneous results. The book serves as a wake-up call, urging readers to adopt a critical approach to scientific data interpretation and offering tools to combat bad science.
#### Thoughts
As a young researcher, this hits close to home. With many examples of how science is sensationalized or even actively falsified, this book is definitely worth reading.
#### My Rating

## [Jeremy Scahill](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/55473.Jeremy_Scahill): [The Assassination Complex: Inside the US government’s secret drone warfare programme](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30120926-the-assassination-complex)
#### Abstract
"The Assassination Complex" by Jeremy Scahill exposes the flaws and civilian impacts of the U.S. drone program, challenging its portrayed precision and legality. It reveals the reliance on flawed intelligence and the lack of due process, calling for transparency and accountability in military operations.

#### Thoughts
Now a few years old, but still a relevant topic. Either I've become desensitized, or it has become too normal, but as of 2023, these issues are no longer truly shocking or unbelievable. Still interesting, though.

### [Mark A. Stoler](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/230010.Mark_A_Stoler): [The Skeptic's Guide to American History](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24501241-the-skeptic-s-guide-to-american-history)

#### Abstract
This lecture series reexamines American history, debunking myths and reevaluating key events and figures like the American Revolution and the Vietnam War. It aims to replace misconceptions with facts, offering a more nuanced understanding of the U.S. historical landscape.

#### Thoughts
Not a traditional book, I listened to it as part of *The Great Courses*. It challenges many widespread views on U.S. history, yet it remains logical and comprehensible throughout. Certainly, it shouldn't be the only source for understanding U.S. history, but it's interesting to see a different perspective.

#### Abstract
"An Immense World" by Ed Yong delves into how animals perceive the world differently from humans, revealing their unique sensory experiences. Through engaging storytelling, Yong explores examples such as beetles attracted to fires and fish communicating with electrical signals, inviting readers to appreciate the complex sensory diversity of animals.

#### Thoughts
The book was one of my favorite reads of the year. Absolutely fascinating stories from various aspects of the animal world, such as the incredibly complex world of bat echolocation and the evolutionary arms race between bats and their prey (e.g., moths).

### [Der Apotheker](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20847831._DerApotheker): [Die Wahrheit über unsere Medikamente: Wann sie helfen, wann sie schaden und wann sie Geldverschwendung sind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55810922-die-wahrheit-ber-unsere-medikamente)
#### Abstract
This book reveals key facts about common medications, such as the dangers of mixing Ibuprofen with ASS100, how Johanniskraut affects birth control effectiveness, and the chemical content of plant-based medicines. It educates on the workings of pharmacy bestsellers, considerations for use, and which products are not worth buying.
#### Thoughts
I have no medical expertise (#Imnotadoctor), so I can't professionally evaluate the book. However, it appears solid and is definitely explained in an understandable and comprehensible manner. It is a bit odd, though, that the author uses a pseudonym instead of their real name, especially since the book doesn't tackle highly controversial topics but rather provides relatively sober discussions on medications that countless people use daily.

#### Abstract
President Trump's 2016 election win was significantly influenced by his evangelical advisors, including a radical TV preacher as his spiritual advisor. These white fundamentalist Christians, combining religious fervor with white supremacy and anti-government views, remain a potent force in U.S. politics.
#### Thoughts

#### Abstract
"The Secret Life of Microbes" by Florian Freistetter and Helmut Jungwirth explores the unseen world of bacteria, viruses, algae, and fungi crucial to our planet's ecosystem. Through 100 insightful chapters, the book showcases their fascinating roles in history, space exploration, and environmental conservation, highlighting the indispensable role microbes play in maintaining life as we know it.

#### Thoughts
There are literally too many fascinating microorganisms to list them all, and this book makes a selection of 100 special curiosities. And even that is too many for me to remember the wonders of the microcosm in any detail. It's definitely a fascinating journey worth recommending. However, the book also feels somewhat randomly assembled, and the editing is not ideal in my opinion (jokes are repeated or explained multiple times, etc.).

#### Abstract
In "Expensive!" Maurice Höfgen analyzes inflation's impact, attributing it to external factors like the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic. While cautioning against panic, he urges policymakers to stabilize living costs to avert economic strain.
#### Thoughts
Just like with medicine (see above), I'm also a complete novice when it comes to economics and finance. I discovered Maurice Höfgen through the podcast [Jung & Naiv](https://www.jungundnaiv.de) that I value highly. The book is certainly one that is very much tied to a specific time (shortly after COVID and after the Ukraine war) and offers little value for future generations.

### [Gerd Kommer](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1107923.Gerd_Kommer): [Kaufen Oder Mieten?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23402234-kaufen-oder-mieten)
#### Abstract
In his book, Gerd Kommer advises caution in the booming real estate market. He emphasizes the importance of skepticism and number crunching, especially with the prevalence of remote work driving up prices. Kommer equips readers with the expertise and online calculation tools needed to assess offers accurately, helping them avoid potential traps.
#### Thoughts
Whether Gerd Kommer provides meaningful insights or not, I (unfortunately) cannot judge. However, his books don't come across as the typical get-rich-quick scheme but rather as profound and based on a myriad of empirical data, researched with relatively clear results and statements (and it acknowledges uncertainty where the data is unsatisfactory or of insufficient quality).

#### Abstract
In his updated classic, Gerd Kommer advises savers on the potential of index funds and ETFs. Drawing from 15 years of experience, he guides readers on constructing personalized portfolios for attractive long-term returns with minimal effort and without traditional banking fees.
#### Thoughts
Even more so than with housing (see above), good advice is expensive when it comes to long-term financial planning, e.g., for retirement. Let's hope that this book is not more style than substance and that it serves as a helpful guide for the sustainable investment of private wealth.

#### Abstract
Johannes Krause's book explores human migration history using insights from genetic research. He traces our journey from Africa to Europe, shedding light on population origins, physical traits evolution, and migration routes. Emphasizing immigrants' role in shaping Europe's history, the book underscores archaeogenetics' importance in understanding our past. Overall, it offers a captivating overview of genetic research's impact on our understanding of human migration and population dynamics.

#### Abstract
Arno Luik's book exposes systemic failures and mismanagement in the Deutsche Bahn, including issues with lobbying, the Stuttgart 21 project, and unreliable services. Despite ample taxpayer funding, the company's performance continues to decline, posing risks to passenger safety. The critique demands accountability from those responsible for its governance.
#### Thoughts
Ah, Deutsche Bahn. Deutsche Bahn is so unreliable and mismanaged that the lived reality has surpassed any jokes on the subject. Not to mention their pricing or app issues. And like many, I've had my fair share of mild annoyances to rage-inducing follies with practically every journey.

I thought this book would technically describe the current state of affairs (dilapidated infrastructure, delays and cancellations, comparison with other countries, etc.), as well as the causes and background of the current situation.

Instead, with each page, this book turned more into a "things were better in the past" rant by an old white man who rejects any change or modernization.

He's entitled to his opinion, but I wouldn't recommend reading it.

#### Abstract
"Encased at the North Pole" tells the story of the largest Arctic expedition ever, launched in September 2019. Led by Markus Rex, scientists from 20 nations spent a year studying climate change's effects in the Arctic. Through exclusive photos and firsthand accounts, Rex shares the challenges, discoveries, and urgency of their mission amidst extreme conditions.
#### Thoughts
While the subject is genuinely fascinating and the travelogue intriguing, this book veers a bit too much towards being a personal diary rather than offering a description of the Arctic, its flora, and fauna.

### [Ronen Steinke](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6820004.Ronen_Steinke): [Vor dem Gesetz sind nicht alle gleich: Die neue Klassenjustiz](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59754830-vor-dem-gesetz-sind-nicht-alle-gleich)

#### Abstract
Ronen Steinke's report uncovers systemic legal injustice, showing how the law disproportionately favors the wealthy over the poor. He points out the minimal consequences for major economic crimes versus harsh penalties for minor offenses. Steinke's findings, based on prison visits and interviews with legal professionals and convicts, demand urgent reforms to achieve true equality before the law.

>Dystopian fiction is when you take things that happen in real life to marginalized populations and apply them to people with privilege.

If you want to gain a better understanding of how marginalized groups (in Germany) are also disadvantaged before the law, then this book is an eye-opening, yet saddening read. The modern constitutional state is a cultural achievement, and although it is often taken for granted, it should not be. However, a system should also be judged by how it treats the socially/financially weak and those who have no one to advocate for them or who have no voice.
