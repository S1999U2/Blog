# Annoyances
I know technology is [amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLkX2VaQs4) and many things are moving at a neckbreaking speed.
Still, from time to time we get frustrated with the devices and services surrounding our daily lives.

As an homage to [Annoying Technology](https://annoying.technology) and to blow off steam when Siri fails me in surprising new ways yet again this page is for some light hearted annoyances[^1].
Besides, someone *has* to be the chronicler of the ever-advancing [enshitification](https://www.dict.cc/?s=chronicler) 😉

[^1]: Seriously – How can Siri still be *this* bad? It's been introduced in 2011.
