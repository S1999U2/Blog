# Magnet is Damaged
[Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com) is a nifty little app that allows Mac users to use Windows-style window snapping[^1].

But: I installed Magnet from the App Store, and I'm running a current Mac and the latest macOS â€“Â how can an app get *damaged* so that the only way to fix it is to reinstall it? I certainly never had any issue like this on an iPhone.

If Apple knows exactly how to fix it and Apple runs the App Store â€“Â why don't they simply reinstall it? I mean isn't an automatic app update more or less the same?

[^1]: Seriously: How is this *still* not a built-in feature? Microsoft introduced [Aero Snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Aero) in 2009[^2] ðŸ¤¯ (ok, now I feel old).
[^2]: I know, I know. Linux[^3] probably had something much more powerful way earlier than even Windows 7.
[^3]: Of course, I know that it's *actually* called [GNU/Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy)
