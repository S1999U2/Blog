# ML-based Autocorrect Sucks
I get wildly wrong predictions since Apple added machine learning-based predictions to its autocorrection/text completion. Why on earth would the German equivalent of â€ž*well then itâ€™sâ€¦*â€œ logically be completed to â€žiStateOfMind3â€œ ðŸ¤·?
I donâ€™t have an app with that name installed, and as far as I know, I never had one.
