# Apple's Privileges
Since iOS and the App Store are Apple's own platforms it gets special privileges and doesn't have to follow its own rules.
Ever seen any third-party app getting such a nice screen asking for permissions?

And how about the dark pattern highlighting the *Enable Notifications*â€¦

Also: *Not Now*? How about never?
