# Optimizing Your Mac
A few days ago, I set up my newly purchased MacBook. So far, so good, but what does "Optimizing Your Mac" mean? I certainly didn't notice any decreased performance or battery life, and I have some idea what it might be doing. But wouldn't it be convenient to provide some more details? Or maybe even see what my Mac is doing?
