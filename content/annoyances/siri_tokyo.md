# Hey Siri, Whatâ€™s the Weather Like in Tokyo?
Siri:
> Here is the weather for Tokio, United States.

Obviously, people refer to [Tokio, North Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokio,_North_Dakota) (or [Tokio, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokio,_Texas)) when they say "Tokyo." (Even [most of the US](https://pudding.cool/2023/03/same-name/?place=Tokio) doesn't refer to any of those two ðŸ¤·).
