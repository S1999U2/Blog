# Hey Siri, Remind Me toâ€¦
Hey Siri, remind me to finish the exam and announcement when I get to work

Siri:
> OK, Intercom to all

Iâ€™ve created literally thousands of reminders with Siri. Siri correctly transcribed my instructions. For no apparent reason Siri utterly fails to set a reminder and sends my query to all the people in my home.

*Intercom* and *remind me* donâ€™t even sound vaguely similar (neither in German nor in English). ðŸ—£
