# Welcome

Hey 👋

I'm Stefan, a PhD student at LUH 🤓👨‍🎓.
I'm curious about almost anything, including science 🧪, technology ⚙️, gaming 🎮, cooking 🧑‍🍳, and music 🎸. 

On this website, you'll find a demo of some of the things I'm working on as well as a [blog section](/blog) where I'll be sharing my thoughts and musings. The exact topics have not yet been set. And although I'm not planning on blogging regularly, I'll be using the blog to experiment and fiddle around with different ideas 🙃. 

Also, I sometimes get [annoyed](/annoyances) by the amazing technology surrounding us. 

If you'd like to connect with me, you can find me on Mastodon at [@Secundus@home.social](https://mastodon.social/@secundus) 🦣.
