# Welcome

Welcome to my website!

My name is Stefan and I am a doctoral student at LUH 🤓👨‍🎓.
I'm curious about almost anything, including science 🧪, technology ⚙️, gaming 🎮, cooking 🧑‍🍳, and music 🎸. On this website, you'll find a demo of some of the things I'm working on as well as a blog section where I'll be sharing my thoughts and musings. The exact topics have not yet been set. And although I'm not planning on blogging regularly, I'll be using the blog to experiment and fiddle around with different ideas 🙃. If you'd like to connect with me, you can find me on Mastodon at [@Secundus@home.social](https://home.social/@Secundus) 🦣.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you find something interesting here!
